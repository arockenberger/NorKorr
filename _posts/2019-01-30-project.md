Quick update: We had been discussing starting with a project management system for NorKorr. I've started today by creating two
so-called "projects" in the repository, one dedicated to the upcoming conference of the Digital Humanities in the Nordic Countries
in March 2019 in Copenhagen [DHN2019](https://github.com/arockenberger/NorKorr/projects/3) and one handling the Phase I tasks
that are roughly outlined in the project description.

This is still pretty much a testing phase for the project management. I have never actively used project management tools before
and will give this a try. It is also my first time as a project lead of a project that involves more than two people. We shall 
whether this works in our favor and generally supports to progress and tasks in NorKorr.

For the time being, I suggest the team members check the status of the projects regularly and file issues with specific tasks
which can be integrated into the project board. Also: when a task is finished, please move the card (by drag-and-drop) into "Done",
likewise, if you have started a task, move it from "To-Do" into "In Progress".

Keep the good work going!
