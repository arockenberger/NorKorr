In March the NorKorr project participated at the [conference of the Digital Humanities in the Nordic Countries in Copenhagen, DHN2019](https://cst.dk/DHN2019/DHN2019.html).

Hilde BÃ¸e and Ellen Wiger represented the project and presented our poster "Norwegian Correspondences and Linked Open Data" at the poster session. We also submitted a paper, this is now available at [CEUR](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2364/33_paper.pdf).

And we even got an award :-)
