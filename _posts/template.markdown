Here comes the text.
300-500 words is a good size.
Use markdown to include links, images, tables etc.

You can visually structure your post with paragraphs; they can be shorter than
in an article.

Stylistically, a blog post often has a more conversational tone. Think essay, not journal article.

If you use references, add them at the end of the blogpost.
