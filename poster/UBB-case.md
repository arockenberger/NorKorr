##Case 4: The letter collections at University of Bergen Library

By focusing on three disparate collections of letters from the Section for Special Collections, we wish to show the value and potential of linking and contextualizing these collections in a correspondence database. 

The first collection, Ms 790, actively collected by the Bank Officer O.J. Larsen, contains c. 2100 letters written by Norwegian and European “celebrities”, from Camilla Collett and Edvard Munch to Napoleon, Goethe and Lord Byron. As a curated collection, the letters defy a “normal” correspondence pattern. However, within a correspondence database new links to similar collections / related letters can elucidate the original correspondence.

The second collection, Ms 2083, contains around 350 letters sent to the physician, leprosy scientist, zoologist, and director at Bergens Museum, D.C. Danielssen (1815-94). This fascinating collection reveals the wide-ranging exchange and collaboration of scientific research and ideas between Danielssen and scientists in Scandinavia and Europe.

Finally, Ms 2155, the Mons Flæsland Collection, is a private collection, containing c. 950 family letters from the period 1895-1930. The collection describes everyday life, relations and destinies through three generations of detailed family letters. This uniquely preserved collection is equally important as a reflection of social conditions and class distinctions.
