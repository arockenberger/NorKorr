# Case 2: Letters to and from Norwegian Artist Edvard Munch (1863–1944)
Norwegian artist Edvard Munch’s correspondence with family and friends, and with assistants, patrons, collectors, art dealers, printers, newspaper and magazine editors, artists, writers, art historians, exhibition organisers, gallery owners, shipping companies, and more, comprises more than 10.000 known letters and letter drafts.

Among the more than 800 senders and 400 recipients currently in our online registers at [https://emunch.no/](https://emunch.no/) are well-known names that are easy to connect to authoritative identifiers, but also many that aren’t. Among those not present in authority registers are Munch’s family and some of the friends he most eagerly exchanged letters with as well as other important people and institutions. The letters are written in Norwegian, German, Danish, Swedish and French as well as the odd occurrence of English, Italian, Spanish, Polish and Czech. The letters span 70 years, from 1874 to 1944, representing hundreds of handwriting styles and many types of letters. Metadata are partially incomplete; Munch himself didn’t always bother adding date and place to letters, and envelopes are often missing, so analysing the content is necessary to discover when and where a letter was written and whereto it was sent.

A presentation of Munch’s correspondence needs to incorporate all of this to be really representative.
